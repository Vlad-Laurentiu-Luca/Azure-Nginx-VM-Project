# Azure-Nginx-VM-Project
This project involves setting up a virtual machine (VM) on Microsoft Azure using Ubuntu 24.04, where I installed Nginx to host a simple website I built for a friend. The website is still under development, featuring HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Key Features:
Nginx Web Server: Installed and configured on an Ubuntu VM to serve static web pages.

Responsive Website Design: The website adjusts its layout depending on the device or screen size (using CSS media queries).
